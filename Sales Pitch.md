### **Sales Pitch for Microsoft Power Platform in Abiola & Co Manufacturing Company**  

Abiola & Co. are facing inefficiencies in handling customer orders and inventory management. The existing process involved multiple spreadsheets, emails, and manual interventions, which has led to errors, delays, and poor visibility into business operation.

Right now, the team is working harder than they should which involves manually processing customers orders, re-
stocking dinventory, and dealing with delays due to disconnected systems. But how about having a fully automated, integrated system that eliminates these inefficiencies, ensuring real-time data flow and faster order fulfillment? That’s exactly what Microsoft Power Platform can do for your business.

### **Understanding the Current Pain Points of Abiola & Co. Manufacturing Company**
I havee analyzed the business operations, and here’s what’s showing down the business efficiency:

- **Manual Order Processing:** Orders come via email and are manually entered, increasing the risk of errors.  
- **Data Silos:** Different departments rely on separate spreadsheets and systems, causing inconsistencies.  
- **Inventory Mismatch:** No real-time updates lead to delays, overstocking, or out of stock.  
- **Lack of Automation:** Approvals are slow, causing delay in order fulfillment.  
- **Limited Reporting:** No analytics for sales trends, customer demand, or stock movement.  

🚨 These inefficiencies lead to lost revenue, delayed deliveries, and lower customer satisfaction.
